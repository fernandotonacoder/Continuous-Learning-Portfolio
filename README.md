# 📚 Continuous Learning Portfolio
### 🎓 Certificates of Completion

This portfolio contains certificates from courses I’ve completed as part of my continuous learning journey. It is regularly updated as I continue to grow professionally.

I view ongoing education as a cornerstone of career development, covering both **technical skills**—such as .NET/C#, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java,C, C++ development, REST APIs, cloud architecture, DevOps, Azure, software testing, and more — and **soft skills**, including communication, teamwork, Agile methodologies like Scrum and so on.
