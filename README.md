# 📚 Continuous Learning Portfolio
### 🎓 Certificates of Completion

This portfolio contains certificates from the courses I’ve completed as part of my continuous learning journey. It is regularly updated as I continue to grow professionally.

I see ongoing education as a cornerstone of career development, covering both **technical skills**—such as .NET/C# development, REST APIs, cloud architecture, DevOps, software testing, and more—and **soft skills**, including communication, teamwork, and Agile methodologies like Scrum.
